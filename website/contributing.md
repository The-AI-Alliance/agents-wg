## How to Contribute to this Project

We welcome your contributions to this project. 

The project's preferred method of communication is through [Github Discussions](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/agents-wg/discussions). 
Feel free to introduce yourself there first. 

Github discussions are preferred because they are asynchronous and can be more inclusive. 
However, we also have regular meetings. You can find the meeting schedule [here]({{ '/join' | relative_url }}).

# Joining the Work Group

At the moment, the work group is in the process of transitioning to a new platform. 

The best way to join is to be active on the [Github Discussions](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/agents-wg/discussions)
and if possible, attend the regular meetings.
