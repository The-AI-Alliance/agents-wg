We did it! We made the website for the working group. Check back soon. Lot's of 
things happening. 

We will be having our first meeting on 
<span id="meeting-time"
        data-utc="2025-03-11T22:00:00Z">
    2025-03-11 22:00 UTC
</span>. 

If you can't make it, no worries, people are from lots of places and tech nerds 
sleep wierd hours, so we prefer to do our business asynchronously anyway. 

You can visit [here]({{ "/join" | relative_url}}) to find links for joining
live meeting and the git discussions.
